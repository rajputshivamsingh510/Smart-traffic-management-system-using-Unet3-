#  Smart Traffic Management System using U-Net3+

This project presents an AI-driven traffic management solution leveraging semantic segmentation with the U-Net3+ architecture. The objective is to segment and understand urban traffic scenes—including roads, vehicles, and lane boundaries—to support smarter traffic control and infrastructure planning.

---

##  Objective

To build a semantic segmentation model capable of identifying and distinguishing key components of road scenes using deep learning, aiding the development of intelligent traffic management systems.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset comprises annotated traffic images stored in Google Drive. Each image is paired with a corresponding mask representing segmented classes such as vehicles, lanes, and roads.

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  

---

##  Project Features

- Data loading and preprocessing pipeline for traffic images and masks  
- Implementation of the U-Net3+ architecture for enhanced feature extraction  
- Model training and evaluation using Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU)  
- Visualization of predictions to assess segmentation accuracy

---

##  How to Run the Project

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`1.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Mount your Google Drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive/')
   ```
3. Update paths to point to your dataset.
4. Run the notebook cells in order to train and evaluate the model.

##  Evaluation

- **Metric Used:** Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU)  
This metric is crucial for evaluating the performance of semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in multi-class environments like urban traffic scenes.

##  Notes

- U-Net3+ offers superior performance in edge preservation and multiscale feature extraction.
- Proper directory structure in Google Drive is essential for seamless data loading.
